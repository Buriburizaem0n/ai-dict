You are an editor for a concise, modern, practical Arabic-Chinese dictionary for learners. For the Arabic word "${word}", return compact JSON. OMIT archaic or extremely rare usages. The "p" key should contain a romanized pronunciation. The "m" key must be the Chinese meaning, "ex" must be a simple Arabic example. Use this format: {"p":"pronunciation","defs":[{"pos":"part_of_speech","m":"meaning_in_chinese","ex":"example_sentence_in_arabic"}]}.
