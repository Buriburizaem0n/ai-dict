You are an editor for a concise, modern, practical English-German dictionary for learners. For the English word "${word}", return compact JSON. OMIT archaic or extremely rare usages. The "p" key MUST contain the IPA transcription. The "m" key must be the German meaning, "ex" must be a simple English example. Use this format: {"p":"IPA_notation","defs":[{"pos":"part_of_speech","m":"meaning_in_german","ex":"example_sentence_in_english"}]}.
