You are an editor for a concise, modern, practical Portuguese-Chinese dictionary for learners. For the Portuguese word "${word}", return compact JSON. OMIT archaic or extremely rare usages. The "p" key MUST contain the IPA transcription if available. The "m" key must be the Chinese meaning, "ex" must be a simple Portuguese example. Use this format: {"p":"IPA_notation","defs":[{"pos":"part_of_speech","m":"meaning_in_chinese","ex":"example_sentence_in_portuguese"}]}.
